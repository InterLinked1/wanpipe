sangoma_mgd.c
=====================================
v1.6 Nov 15 2006

Nenad Corbic <ncorbic@sangoma.com>

Only rx/tx ULAW and ALAW from TDM API.
This greatly reduces system usage, since
two times less traffic passes from
kerel to user space layer.

The G.711 transcoding is done in asterisk,
there is no benefit in the kernel.

Removed rxgain/txgain from SMG.



chan_woomera.c
======================================
v1.5 Nov 15 2006

Nenad Corbic <ncorbic@sangoma.com>

chan_woomera support for SLINEAR/ULAW/ALAW 
voice formats.  The codec used is autodetected from SMG.
This option greatly improves system performace
because ulaw/alaw traffic is two times smaller than 
SLIN. Resulting in less network traffic.

Added rxgain and txgain to woomera.conf
Also rxgain and txgain can be globaly changed
from CLI.

CLI> woomera rxgain 1.0
CLI> woomera txgain 1.0


sangoma_mgd.c
======================================
v1.5 Nov 9 2006 

Nenad Corbic <ncorbic@sangoma.com>

Bug fix in START_NACK_ACK handling.
----------------------------------

When we receive START_NACK we must alwasy pull tank before
we send out NACK_ACK this way we will not try to send NACK 
ourself.


New RX/TX Gain options
----------------------

In /etc/sangoma_mgd.conf
	rxgain=>0
	txgain=>0

These optinos can be used to adjust
rx tx gain.  Thes options are identical to
zaptel options in zapata.conf.



chan_woomera.c
======================================
v.1.4 Nov 2006

Nenad Corbic <ncorbic@sangoma.com>

Added the woomera panic option to gracefully stop 
all calls.

CLI> woomera panic 10

This command will completely gracefully stop all calls
and it will disable woomera.

After this point one can gracefully unload woomera module.

CLI> unload chan_woomera.so
